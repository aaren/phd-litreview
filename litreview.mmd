Gravity currents
----------------

Releasing one fluid from behind a barrier into another fluid is a
conceptually simple problem that has generated a vast literature. We
refer to the movement of fluid following the release of the barrier
as a *gravity current*.

The simplicity of this problem leads to its appearance in a wide
variety of natural phenomena. The flow of water from the Amazon into
the Atlantic, fire propagation in buildings and carbon sequestration
are all examples in which gravity currents play a key role.

This work is primarily motivated by the occurence of gravity
currents in the atmosphere, in particular those generated in the
heart of the intense storm systems found in West Africa.

The behaviour of gravity currents is multifaceted and complex. The
turbulence in the core of a gravity current is sheared and
stratified, presenting a formidable problem.

When incident on a fluid of variable density fluid, gravity currents
display a wide range of interaction with waves in the fluid leading
to a zoo of phenomena.




Here we review the basic properties of gravity currents in a lab
setting.
