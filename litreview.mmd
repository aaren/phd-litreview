Gravity currents
----------------

Releasing one fluid from behind a barrier into another fluid is a
conceptually simple problem that has generated a vast literature. We
refer to the movement of fluid following the release of the barrier
as a *gravity current*.

The simplicity of this problem leads to its appearance in a wide
variety of natural phenomena. The flow of water from the Amazon into
the Atlantic, fire propagation in buildings and carbon sequestration
are all examples in which gravity currents play a key role.

This work is primarily motivated by the occurence of gravity
currents in the atmosphere, in particular those generated in the
heart of the intense storm systems found in West Africa.

The behaviour of gravity currents is multifaceted and complex. The
turbulence in the core of a gravity current is sheared and
stratified, presenting a formidable analytical problem.

When incident on a fluid of variable density fluid, gravity currents
display a wide range of interaction with waves in the fluid leading
to a zoo of phenomena.

### Fundamentals ###

Here we review the basic properties of gravity currents in a lab
setting.

The paradigm for the investigation of gravity currents in the
laboratory is the lock release experiment. A rectangular tank
(typically of dimensions $0.2m$ wide, $0.2m$ deep and between $1$ and
$6m$ long) has an impermeable barrier inserted transversely near to
one end, forming two distinct chambers in the tank. Each chamber is
filled with fluid of a different density, typically achieved using
varying concentrations of saline.

The experiment is initiated by quickly removing the gate. The fluids
are now in an unstable configuration and the resulting motion
creates a gravity current.

Other configurations are used to investigate gravity currents. We
might inject the dense fluid into the tank through a pipe, altering
the governing equations by giving a constant mass flux rather than
conserving mass.

Through the use of a conveyor belt in the floor of the tank and a
system for recirculating the ambient fluid through the tank (often
called a 'racetrack'), we can shift our frame of reference and
arrest the motion of the gravity current. This allows for
investigation of the gravity current in the 'steady state' and the
choice of a slip or free-slip boundary condition at the base.


#### Lifecyle of a gravity current ####

A gravity current originating from a finite initial volume goes
through a number of stages [#huppert-simpson1980, rottman-simpson1983, cantero-etal2007]:
an *acceleration phase* where the initial volume collapses to the
current; a *slumping phase* where the current is retarded by the
counterflow into the lock, with a buoyancy flux from the lock ??physically
correct?? wording??; an *inertial phase* where the current moves
under the balance of inertial and buoyancy forces, with the buoyancy
supplied from within the current; a *viscous phase* where viscous
effects balance buoyancy.

As the volume of dense fluid collapses to form the gravity current,
lighter fluid must fill its place. The transition between the
slumping and intertial stages occurs when the current is no longer
affected by this counterflow. A disturbance on the dense-light
interface, associated with the counterflow, initially propagates
backwards to the symmetry plane of the lock where it is reflected.
This disturbance travels faster than the current front and
transition to the inertial phase occurs when it overtakes the
current front [#rottman-simpson1983].

These phases are distinguished by their velocity time dependence

- Acceleration (short lived, rapid transition to slumping)
- Slumping (approximately constant velocity)
- Self-similar ($~t^{-1/3}$)
- Viscous ($~t^{-4/5}$)

[#amy-etal2005;] used Glycerol to control the Reynolds number of
their flows through viscosity and found that laboratory currents
with $Re < 1000$ undergo abrupt transitions between phases.

[#huppert-simpson1980;] found that the current may transition
directly from the slumping to the viscous phase.




#### Dimensional Analysis ####

#### Analytical treatment ####

By considering the conservation of mass, momentum and energy (via
Bernoulli's equation) we can obtain analytic solutions to the
gravity current problem with certain assumptions.

Assumptions:
- neglect internal motions 
- immiscible fluids 
- Boussinesq










Similarity
----------

Atmospheric gravity currents are roughly $1km$ deep. The gravity
currents formed in a typical lock release experiment are of order
$10cm$ deep. This is a difference in scale of 4 orders of magnitude,
requiring us to ask whether these phenomena are comparable. Can we
really do small experiments in the lab and expect our results to
hold true in the field?
